Background
============
Integrating AI in clinical decision support systems aims to enhance patient care. However, a major challenge is the lack of principled uncertainty quantification in machine learning models, especially in multimodal learning, which limits real-world deployment. We introduce MedCertAIn, a framework using tailored data-driven prior distributions over neural network parameters to improve uncertainty quantification. Implemented using JAX, MedCertAIn leverages the MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-CXR datasets to predict patient mortality in the ICU. Our results show that MedCertAIn significantly improves predictive performance and uncertainty metrics, outperforming current methods and demonstrating its potential for more reliable AI-driven healthcare applications.

Getting started
====================================

To get started with the MedCertAIn framework, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Conda environment (recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MedCertAIn.git
   cd MedCertAIn

2. Clone the repository:

    ```conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate MedCertAIn

3. Refer to **shell_scripts/** and **job_files/** folders for specific cases of model training

*Note: we are currently in the process of preparing model weights for all trained models (i.e. unimodal and multimodal) adjusting the shell scripts for easier implementation.*
